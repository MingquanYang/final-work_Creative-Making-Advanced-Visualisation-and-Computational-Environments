The game centers on memory retrieval and emotional awakening. Players accompany the protagonist on a journey to rediscover lost memories and awaken buried emotions. The story begins with the protagonist returning to an abandoned old house to move out. An old teddy bear hidden in the trash unlocks past memories, triggering a journey of time and emotional exploration.
With non-linear storytelling, players traverse different time periods, uncovering layers of memories to understand the protagonist's complex past of familial entanglements and hidden shadows. Through reverse chronological order, environmental interactions, and investigation, players reconstruct a seemingly happy family life while exploring how a tragedy affected the protagonist and his family. On his birthday, his sister sacrificed herself in a car accident to save him, leading to endless parental arguments and the family's breakdown, leaving the protagonist with guilt and pain.
Players are emotional participants, discovering memory clues in the old house, joining the protagonist in confronting hidden pain, and moving towards reconciliation and release. This game explores deep emotional resonance and understanding through its quest for memories.
